## Run the program
To run the program, use the provided makefile and run `make` to build the program, then run it
with `$ java bin/Main.class.` To run the test suite, you must build ConverterTest.java
with the JUnit jar in your classpath, and run it there as well. If you have a Java IDE, simply import this project
into that IDE and run the code, and you can ignore the makefile.
